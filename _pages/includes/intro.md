# About me
I'm now a second-year master student at Tsinghua University, co-supervised by Prof. Wenwu Zhu and Yansong Tang. 


My research interests include **disentangled representation learning, model compression, and text-to-image/video generation, etc.** In the past year, I mainly focused on **efficient diffusion models** through various compression techniques such as model quantization. In the future, I will continue to work in the field of efficient diffusion models, and meanwhile explore **diffusion-based applications.**
